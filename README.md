# Formal Verification of Modified Version of Wigderson's Algorithm for 3-colorable graphs.
**Created by: Ben Siraphob (siraben) and Jamison Homatas (jhomatas48)**

We present a formal proof of an approximate a coloring for 3-colorable graphs. Our algorithm is based upon Avi Wigderson's algorithm, and we have modified this to be more explicit and rigorous. We implement this as a functional program in Gallina. This repo includes definitions for graphs and graph components and all other data structures used. See the attached [paper](./paper.pdf) for more information.

Using Nix, run `nix-shell` then run `make` to compile it.
