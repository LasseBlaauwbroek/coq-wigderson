# Towards the Formal Verification of Wigdersonâ€™s Algorithm
**Created by: Ben Siraphob (siraben) and Jamison Homatas (jhomatas48)**

We present progress towards the formal verification of Wigderson's
graph coloring algorithm in Coq. We have created a library of
formalized graph theory that aims to bridge the literature gap between
introductory material on Coq and large-scale formal developments,
while providing a motivating case study. Our library contains over 180
proven theorems.

Using Nix, run `nix-shell` then run `make` to compile it.
