# Graph Coloring Algorithm in Coq
## Formal Verification of Modified Version of Wigderson's Algorithm for 3-colorable graphs.

**Created by: Jamison Homatas (jhomatas48) and Ben Siraphob (siraben)**

Here we present a step by step proof to verify an algorithm to approximate a coloring of 3-colorable graphs. Our algorithm is based upon Avi Wigderson's algorithm, and we have modified this to be more explicit and rigorous. We implement this as a functional program in Gallina. This repo includes definitions for graphs and graph components and all other data structures used. See the attached paper for more information.
